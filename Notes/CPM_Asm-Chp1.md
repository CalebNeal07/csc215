## History of the Intel 8080
 - The 8080 was important because its instruction set was powerful enough to actually use for general purpose work and it was readily available.
 - The 8085 was a simpler to use and faster derivative of the 8080.

## Addressing Disk Storage
 - Disk have tracks which are broken into sectors.
 - Data recieved by addressing a sector will be a string of bytes, not just one.
 - A sector's address will look something like track 14 sector 23.
 - CP/M abstracts away direct disk addressing in exchange for file system.
