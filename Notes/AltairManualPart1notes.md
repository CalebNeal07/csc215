## Introduction
 - The Altair 8800 uses the Intel 8080 Chip.
 - The manual is designed to be approachable to begginers and prepare anyone to use the Altair 8800.

## Logic
 - Logic can be repersented with mathematics.
 - Digital computing is founded upon the idea of mathematical logic established by George Boole.
 - Boole's system of logic is based on the idea that a statement is either true or false.
 - The three basic logic statements, or gates, are AND, OR, & NOT.
 - The truth tables for each of these are below.

 **AND**
 | A | B | Out |
 |---|---|-----|
 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
 | 0 | 1 |  0  |
 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
 | 1 | 1 |  1  |

 **OR**
 | A | B | Out |
 |---|---|-----|
 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
 | 0 | 1 |  1  |
 | 1 | 0 |  1  |
 | 1 | 1 |  1  |

 **NOT**
 | A | Out |
 |---|-----|
 | 0 |  1  |
 | 1 |  0  |

## Electonic Logic
 - These logic gates are implemented with transistors, a type of electronic switch.
 - The symbols for AND, OR, & NOT are <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="white" d="M2 4v16h12a8 8 0 0 0 8-8a8 8 0 0 0-8-8zm2 2h10a6 6 0 0 1 6 6a6 6 0 0 1-6 6H4z"/></svg>, <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="white" d="M2 4v16h12a8 8 0 0 0 8-8a8 8 0 0 0-8-8zm2 2h10a6 6 0 0 1 6 6a6 6 0 0 1-6 6H4z"/></svg>, & <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="white" d="M2 4v16l14.2-7c.42 1.19 1.54 2 2.8 2a3 3 0 0 0 3-3a3 3 0 0 0-3-3c-1.26 0-2.38.81-2.8 2zm2 3.3l9.7 4.7L4 16.7zM19 11c.5 0 1 .5 1 1s-.5 1-1 1a1 1 0 0 1-1-1c0-.5.5-1 1-1"/></svg>, respectivly.
 - These gates can be combined to create the composite gates NAND & NOR which are the negation of AND & OR respectively.
 - These gates can be combined to create even more comples behavior like the XOR gate.
