## Introduction
 - The Altair 8800 uses the Intel 8080 Chip
 - The manual is designed to be approachable to begginers and prepare anyone to use the Altair 8800

## Logic
 - Logic can be repersented with mathematics
 - Digital computing is founded upon the idea of mathematical logic established by George Boole
 - Boole's system of logic is based on the idea that a statement is either true or false
 - The three basic logic statements, or gates, are AND, OR, & NOT
 - The truth tables for each of these are below

 **AND**
 | A | B | Out |
 |---|---|-----|
 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
 | 0 | 1 |  0  |
 | 1 | 0 |  0  |
 | 1 | 1 |  1  |

 **OR**
 | A | B | Out |
 |---|---|-----|
 | 0 | 0 |  0  |
 | 0 | 1 |  1  |
 | 1 | 0 |  1  |
 | 1 | 1 |  1  |

 **NOT**
 | A | Out |
 |---|-----|
 | 0 |  1  |
 | 1 |  0  |
